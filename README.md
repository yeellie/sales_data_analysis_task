## Tableau Findings

_All currencies were unified into euros for simplicity for next visualisations._

1. Most merchants have been with the company for around 4 years, having been registered since 2020. Despite being registered, some made their first transaction months later.

2. A notable spike in data corresponds to a transaction for merchant 100, amounting to almost 4 million HUF. This could be an outlier, faulty data entry, or an unusually large purchase. The overall trend was stable before June 2021.

3. The dataset shows Euro as the most popular currency for merchants, followed by the Hungarian forint. Some, like merchant 188, use multiple currencies (EUR and HUF). Merchant 2 is assumed to be primarily based or uses Teya in the UK. Merchants 75 and 20 have the highest transaction count and number. The largest number of terminals is owned by merchant 100. Overall, merchant 75 has high positions in metrics like total transaction amount and number of these transactions with 3 terminals in use.
